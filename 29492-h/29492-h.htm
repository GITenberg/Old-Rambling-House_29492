<h1><big>Old Rambling House</big></h1>

<h2>By FRANK HERBERT</h2>

<div class="bk1"><p><big><b><i>All the Grahams desired was a
home they could call their own
... but what did the home want?</i></b></big></p></div>

<div class="bk2"><p><big><b>Illustrated by JOHNSON</b></big></p></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">On</span> his last night on Earth,
Ted Graham stepped out
of a glass-walled telephone
booth, ducked to avoid a
swooping moth that battered itself
in a frenzy against a bare globe
above the booth.</p>

<p>Ted Graham was a long-necked
man with a head of pronounced
egg shape topped by prematurely
balding sandy hair. Something
about his lanky, intense appearance
suggested his occupation: certified
public accountant.</p>

<p>He stopped behind his wife,
who was studying a newspaper
classified page, and frowned.
"They said to wait here. They'll
come get us. Said the place is hard
to find at night."</p>

<p>Martha Graham looked up from
the newspaper. She was a doll-faced
woman, heavily pregnant, a
kind of pink prettiness about her.
The yellow glow from the light
above the booth subdued the red-auburn
cast of her ponytail hair.</p>

<p>"I just <i>have</i> to be in a house
when the baby's born," she said.
"What'd they sound like?"</p>

<p>"I dunno. There was a funny
kind of interruption&mdash;like an argument
in some foreign language."</p>

<p>"Did they sound foreign?"</p>

<p>"In a way." He motioned along
the night-shrouded line of trailers
toward one with two windows
glowing amber. "Let's wait inside.
These bugs out here are fierce."</p>

<p>"Did you tell them which trailer
is ours?"</p>

<p>"Yes. They didn't sound at all
anxious to look at it. That's odd&mdash;them
wanting to trade their house
for a trailer."</p>

<p>"There's nothing odd about it.
They've probably just got itchy
feet like we did."</p>

<p>He appeared not to hear her.
"Funniest-sounding language you
ever heard when that argument
started&mdash;like a squirt of noise."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Inside</span> the trailer, Ted Graham
sat down on the green couch
that opened into a double bed for
company.</p>

<p>"They could use a good tax accountant
around here," he said.
"When I first saw the place, I got
that definite feeling. The valley
looks prosperous. It's a wonder
nobody's opened an office here
before."</p>

<p>His wife took a straight chair
by the counter separating kitchen
and living area, folded her hands
across her heavy stomach.</p>

<p>"I'm just continental tired of
wheels going around under me,"
she said. "I want to sit and stare
at the same view for the rest of
my life. I don't know how a trailer
ever seemed glamorous when&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It was the inheritance gave us
itchy feet," he said.</p>

<p>Tires gritted on gravel outside.</p>

<p>Martha Graham straightened.
"Could that be them?"</p>

<p>"Awful quick, if it is." He went
to the door, opened it, stared down
at the man who was just raising
a hand to knock.</p>

<p>"Are you Mr. Graham?" asked
the man.</p>

<p>"Yes." He found himself staring
at the caller.</p>

<p>"I'm Clint Rush. You called
about the house?" The man moved
farther into the light. At first, he'd
appeared an old man, fine wrinkle
lines in his face, a tired leather look
to his skin. But as he moved his
head in the light, the wrinkles
seemed to dissolve&mdash;and with them,
the years lifted from him.</p>

<p>"Yes, we called," said Ted
Graham. He stood aside. "Do you
want to look at the trailer now?"</p>

<p>Martha Graham crossed to
stand beside her husband. "We've
kept it in awfully good shape," she
said. "We've never let anything
get seriously wrong with it."</p>

<p><i>She sounds too anxious</i>, thought
Ted Graham. <i>I wish she'd let me
do the talking for the two of us.</i></p>

<p>"We can come back and look
at your trailer tomorrow in daylight,"
said Rush. "My car's right
out here, if you'd like to see our
house."</p>

<p>Ted Graham hesitated. He felt
a nagging worry tug at his mind,
tried to fix his attention on what
bothered him.</p>

<p>"Hadn't we better take our
car?" he asked. "We could follow
you."</p>

<p>"No need," said Rush. "We're
coming back into town tonight
anyway. We can drop you off
then."</p>

<p>Ted Graham nodded. "Be right
with you as soon as I lock up."</p>

<p>Inside the car, Rush mumbled
introductions. His wife was a dark
shadow in the front seat, her hair
drawn back in a severe bun. Her
features suggested gypsy blood. He
called her Raimee.</p>

<p><i>Odd name</i>, thought Ted Graham.
And he noticed that she, too,
gave that strange first impression
of age that melted in a shift of
light.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rush turned her gypsy
features toward Martha Graham.
"You are going to have a baby?"</p>

<p>It came out as an odd, veiled
statement.</p>

<p>Abruptly, the car rolled forward.</p>

<p>Martha Graham said, "It's supposed
to be born in about two
months. We hope it's a boy."</p>

<p>Mrs. Rush looked at her husband.
"I have changed my mind,"
she said.</p>

<p>Rush spoke without taking his
attention from the road. "It is
too ..." He broke off, spoke in
a tumble of strange sounds.</p>

<p>Ted Graham recognized it as
the language he'd heard on the
telephone.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rush answered in the same
tongue, anger showing in the intensity
of her voice. Her husband
replied, his voice calmer.</p>

<p>Presently, Mrs. Rush fell moodily
silent.</p>

<p>Rush tipped his head toward
the rear of the car. "My wife has
moments when she does not want
to get rid of the old house. It has
been with her for many years."</p>

<p>Ted Graham said, "Oh." Then:
"Are you Spanish?"</p>

<p>Rush hesitated. "No. We are
Basque."</p>

<p>He turned the car down a well-lighted
avenue that merged into a
highway. They turned onto a side
road. There followed more turns&mdash;left,
right, right.</p>

<p>Ted Graham lost track.</p>

<p>They hit a jolting bump that
made Martha gasp.</p>

<p>"I hope that wasn't too rough
on you," said Rush. "We're almost
there."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> car swung into a lane, its
lights picking out the skeleton
outlines of trees: peculiar trees&mdash;tall,
gaunt, leafless. They added to
Ted Graham's feeling of uneasiness.</p>

<p>The lane dipped, ended at a low
wall of a house&mdash;red brick with
clerestory windows beneath overhanging
eaves. The effect of the
wall and a wide-beamed door they
could see to the left was ultramodern.</p>

<p>Ted Graham helped his wife out
of the car, followed the Rushes to
the door.</p>

<p>"I thought you told me it was
an old house," he said.</p>

<p>"It was designed by one of the
first modernists," said Rush. He
fumbled with an odd curved key.
The wide door swung open onto
a hallway equally wide, carpeted
by a deep pile rug. They could
glimpse floor-to-ceiling view windows
at the end of the hall, city
lights beyond.</p>

<p>Martha Graham gasped, entered
the hall as though in a trance.
Ted Graham followed, heard the
door close behind them.</p>

<p>"It's so&mdash;so&mdash;so <i>big</i>," exclaimed
Martha Graham.</p>

<p>"You want to trade <i>this</i> for our
trailer?" asked Ted Graham.</p>

<p>"It's too inconvenient for us,"
said Rush. "My work is over the
mountains on the coast." He
shrugged. "We cannot sell it."</p>

<p>Ted Graham looked at him
sharply. "Isn't there any money
around here?" He had a sudden
vision of a tax accountant with no
customers.</p>

<p>"Plenty of money, but no real
estate customers."</p>

<p>They entered the living room.
Sectional divans lined the walls.
Subdued lighting glowed from the
corners. Two paintings hung on
the opposite walls&mdash;oblongs of odd
lines and twists that made Ted
Graham dizzy.</p>

<p>Warning bells clamored in his
mind.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Martha</span> Graham crossed to
the windows, looked at the
lights far away below. "I had no
idea we'd climbed that far," she
said. "It's like a fairy city."</p>

<p>Mrs. Rush emitted a short, nervous
laugh.</p>

<p>Ted Graham glanced around the
room, thought: <i>If the rest of the
house is like this, it's worth fifty
or sixty thousand</i>. He thought of
the trailer: <i>A good one, but not
worth more than seven thousand</i>.</p>

<p>Uneasiness was like a neon sign
flashing in his mind. "This seems
so ..." He shook his head.</p>

<p>"Would you like to see the rest
of the house?" asked Rush.</p>

<p>Martha Graham turned from
the window. "Oh, yes."</p>

<p>Ted Graham shrugged. <i>No harm
in looking</i>, he thought.</p>

<p>When they returned to the living
room, Ted Graham had
doubled his previous estimate on
the house's value. His brain reeled
with the summing of it: a solarium
with an entire ceiling covered by
sun lamps, an automatic laundry
where you dropped soiled clothing
down a chute, took it washed and
ironed from the other end ...</p>

<p>"Perhaps you and your wife
would like to discuss it in private,"
said Rush. "We will leave you for
a moment."</p>

<p>And they were gone before Ted
Graham could protest.</p>

<p>Martha Graham said, "Ted, I honestly
never in my life dreamed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Something's very wrong, honey."</p>

<p>"But, Ted&mdash;"</p>

<p>"This house is worth at least a
hundred thousand dollars. Maybe
more. And they want to trade
<i>this</i>&mdash;" he looked around him&mdash;"for
a seven-thousand-dollar trailer?"</p>

<p>"Ted, they're foreigners. And if
they're so foolish they don't know
the value of this place, then why
should&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't like it," he said. Again
he looked around the room, recalled
the fantastic equipment of
the house. "But maybe you're
right."</p>

<p>He stared out at the city lights.
They had a lacelike quality: tall
buildings linked by lines of flickering
incandescence. Something
like a Roman candle shot skyward
in the distance.</p>

<p>"Okay!" he said. "If they want
to trade, let's go push the deal ..."</p>

<p>Abruptly, the house shuddered.
The city lights blinked out. A humming
sound filled the air.</p>

<p>Martha Graham clutched her
husband's arm. "Ted! Wha&mdash; what
was that?"</p>

<p>"I dunno." He turned. "Mr.
Rush!"</p>

<p>No answer. Only the humming.</p>

<p>The door at the end of the room
opened. A strange man came
through it. He wore a short toga-like
garment of gray, metallic
cloth belted at the waist by something
that glittered and shimmered
through every color of the spectrum.
An aura of coldness and
power emanated from him&mdash;a sense
of untouchable hauteur.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">He</span> glanced around the room,
spoke in the same tongue the
Rushes had used.</p>

<p>Ted Graham said, "I don't understand
you, mister."</p>

<p>The man put a hand to his flickering
belt. Both Ted and Martha
Graham felt themselves rooted to
the floor, a tingling sensation vibrating
along every nerve.</p>

<p>Again the strange language
rolled from the man's tongue, but
now the words were understood.</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>"My name's Graham. This is
my wife. What's going&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How did you get here?"</p>

<p>"The Rushes&mdash;they wanted to
trade us this house for our trailer.
They brought us. Now look, we&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What is your talent&mdash;your occupation?"</p>

<p>"Tax accountant. Say! Why all
these&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That was to be expected," said
the man. "Clever! Oh, excessively
clever!" His hand moved again to
the belt. "Now be very quiet. This
may confuse you momentarily."</p>

<p>Colored lights filled both the
Grahams' minds. They staggered.</p>

<p>"You are qualified," said the
man. "You will serve."</p>

<p>"Where are we?" demanded
Martha Graham.</p>

<p>"The coordinates would not be
intelligible to you," he said. "I am
of the Rojac. It is sufficient for
you to know that you are under
Rojac sovereignty."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Ted</span> Graham said, "But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You have, in a way, been kidnapped.
And the Raimees have
fled to your planet&mdash;an unregistered
planet."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid," Martha Graham
said shakily.</p>

<p>"You have nothing to fear," said
the man. "You are no longer on
the planet of your birth&mdash;nor even
in the same galaxy." He glanced
at Ted Graham's wrist. "That device
on your wrist&mdash;it tells your
local time?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"That will help in the search.
And your sun&mdash;can you describe
its atomic cycle?"</p>

<p>Ted Graham groped in his mind
for his science memories from
school, from the Sunday supplements.
"I can recall that our galaxy
is a spiral like&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Most galaxies are spiral."</p>

<p>"Is this some kind of a practical
joke?" asked Ted Graham.</p>

<p>The man smiled, a cold, superior
smile. "It is no joke. Now I will
make you a proposition."</p>

<p>Ted nodded warily. "All right,
let's have the stinger."</p>

<p>"The people who brought you
here were tax collectors we Rojac
recruited from a subject planet.
They were conditioned to make it
impossible for them to leave their
job untended. Unfortunately, they
were clever enough to realize that
if they brought someone else in
who could do their job, they were
released from their mental bonds.
Very clever."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You may have their job," said
the man. "Normally, you would
be put to work in the lower echelons,
but we believe in meting out
justice wherever possible. The
Raimees undoubtedly stumbled on
your planet by accident and lured
you into this position without&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How do you know I can do
your job?"</p>

<p>"That moment of brilliance was
an aptitude test. You passed. Well,
do you accept?"</p>

<p>"What about our baby?" Martha
Graham worriedly wanted to
know.</p>

<p>"You will be allowed to keep it
until it reaches the age of decision&mdash;about
the time it will take the
child to reach adult stature."</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/001.png" width="374" height="500" alt="" title="" /></div>

<p>"Then what?" insisted Martha
Graham.</p>

<p>"The child will take its position
in society&mdash;according to its ability."</p>

<p>"Will we ever see our child
after that?"</p>

<p>"Possibly."</p>

<p>Ted Graham said, "What's the
joker in this?"</p>

<p>Again the cold, superior smile.
"You will receive conditioning
similar to that which we gave the
Raimees. And we will want to
examine your memories to aid us
in our search for your planet. It
would be good to find a new inhabitable
place."</p>

<p>"Why did they trap us like
this?" asked Martha Graham.</p>

<p>"It's lonely work," the man explained.
"Your house is actually a
type of space conveyance that
travels along your collection route&mdash;and
there is much travel to the
job. And then&mdash;you will not have
friends, nor time for much other
than work. Our methods are necessarily
severe at times."</p>

<p>"<i>Travel?</i>" Martha Graham repeated
in dismay.</p>

<p>"Almost constantly."</p>

<p>Ted Graham felt his mind whirling.
And behind him, he heard his
wife sobbing.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> Raimees sat in what had
been the Grahams' trailer.</p>

<p>"For a few moments, I feared
he would not succumb to the bait,"
she said. "I knew you could never
overcome the mental compulsion
enough to leave them there without
their first agreeing."</p>

<p>Raimee chuckled. "Yes. And
now I'm going to indulge in everything
the Rojac never permitted.
I'm going to write ballads and
poems."</p>

<p>"And I'm going to paint," she
said. "Oh, the delicious freedom!"</p>

<p>"Greed won this for us," he said.
"The long study of the Grahams
paid off. They couldn't refuse to
trade."</p>

<p>"I knew they'd agree. The looks
in their eyes when they saw the
house! They both had ..." She
broke off, a look of horror coming
into her eyes. "One of them did
not agree!"</p>

<p>"They both did. You heard
them."</p>

<p>"The baby?"</p>

<p>He stared at his wife. "But&mdash;but
it is not at the age of decision!"</p>

<p>"In perhaps eighteen of this
planet's years, it <i>will</i> be at the
age of decision. What then?"</p>

<p>His shoulders sagged. He shuddered.
"I will not be able to fight
it off. I will have to build a transmitter,
call the Rojac and confess!"</p>

<p>"And they will collect another
inhabitable place," she said, her
voice flat and toneless.</p>

<p>"I've spoiled it," he said. "I've
spoiled it!"</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
